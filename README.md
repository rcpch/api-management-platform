# api-management-platform
A repository which exists just for the Issues.

* We use this repo for reporting of Issues with the RCPCH API Management platform [dev.rcpch.ac.uk](dev.rcpch.ac.uk)

* This platform is a Contoso APIM instance on Azure. We therefore don't have complete control over the look and feel of it, but we can make some UI tweaks, and of course if there is something factually wrong with our API definition, documentation, examples, or anything else, this is the place to report it.  

* For security related or other confidential disclosure please contact it.support@rcpch.ac.uk
